# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Never commit the actual .env file to version control
# 2. The .env file is already in .gitignore
# 3. Only use VITE_ prefix for variables that should be exposed to the client
# 4. Keep sensitive API keys in Supabase Edge Functions, not in client code
# 5. The anon key is safe to expose as it's protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
